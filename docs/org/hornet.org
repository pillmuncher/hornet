* Introduction

  Hornet is a small embedded DSL for representing Horn clauses and constructing
  a Herbrand universe in Python.  It uses self-constructing expression trees and
  a resolution engine composed of *monadic combinators*.

  The engine captures Prolog's semantics by means of a *Triple-Barrelled
  Continuation Monad* carrying three continuations: =yes=, =no=, and =prune=.
  The =prune= continuation corresponds to the Prolog =cut= operator.

  Before introducing the core logic, we begin with two foundational modules: one
  for *tail-call elimination*, and another for *state threading*.

* Next Steps
1. Document the =Triple-Barrelled Continuation Monad=.
2. Integrate =tailcalls= and =states= into the resolution engine.
3. Add sections for:
   - Representation of terms and clauses
   - Unification
   - Rule expansion
   - Query evaluation
   - Cut handling (=prune=)
